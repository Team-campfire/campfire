   <p>Anaheim is home to the Anaheim Angels, professional baseball team as well as the Anaheim Ducks hockey team. There’s also softball leagues, tennis, and golf.</p>
   <p>Sure, your group can take in a game at one of the stadiums but that’s not the only thing sports lovers can do. Provide a unique experience by going on a behind-the-scenes tour with your group at the Anaheim Angels Stadium. Sit in the dugout, meander through the visitor’s clubhouse, and take a selfie in the broadcast booth. There are also several sports-themed eateries for your guests to enjoy including The Catch at the Angels Stadium.</p>

   <p><strong>FOOD TRUCK RALLIES</strong></p>
   <p>The beautiful weather makes Orange County the ideal spot for food trucks and an outdoor dining experience. You can bring in food trucks for your event at the convention center or simply catch the trucks around the area. These moveable feasts offer tons of choices and ethnic options from Germany, Thailand, Mexico, Italy and more, as well as culinary delights for every course (including dessert).</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><strong>HIGH ENERGY AND ECONOMICAL FUN</strong></p>
   <p>Want a completely different experience for your group? How about a flight simulator? Or catch the Disneyland fireworks from the convention center or a rooftop restaurant and bar. There are also over 800 events that occur in this area monthly and the destination services team provides details of those that will impact, or are of interest, to meeting groups.</p>
   <p>With so much to do, many event planners assume Anaheim/Orange County area is an expensive destination. That is not the case. There are plenty of opportunities for discounts and savings. Visit Anaheim partners with several local vendors in a “Show Your Badge and Save” program. They offer convention and meeting goers discounts on things like rental cars, restaurants, bars, attractions, shuttles, and more.</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><strong>ORANGE COUNTY FOR GROUPS</strong></p>
   <p>There is a lot to do in the Anaheim area and if you’re looking for some group activities don’t forget team-building attractions like escape room challenges and murder mystery dinners. There are also opportunities for Improv, food tours, city hunts, game trucks, and cooking schools. There are also dinner theater adventures where group tickets can be arranged.</p>
   <p>If you can envision it, there’s likely a group in town that can turn it into a team activity for you and your meeting attendees. Anaheim is a town of performers and creatives. The Disney roots provide a lot of opportunity for offering something completely unexpected for your group.</p>
   <p>Orange County is a popular spot for conferences and meetings for so many reasons, including its ease of access. For flights, there’s no reason to go through LAX. Orange County is easily accessed through John Wayne Airport. In 2018, it was named best airport by Time/Money for its customer experience, travel reviews, on-time arrival rates, and traveler amenities. As a bonus, there’s also a statue of The Duke, which serves as a great Insta op.</p>
   <p>Attendees will love the ability to add on additional time for family vacations. The OC’s close proximity to other popular areas of California gives guests an inexpensive way to enjoy top tourist attractions. There’s a reason Anaheim keeps breaking records for visitors each year!</p>
   <p>&nbsp;</p>
   <p><strong>IN CONCLUSION</strong></p>
   <p>SoCal is more than just a geographical location for your next event. It brings an expectation of energy and level of fun few locations can command. Your attendees already have very set views of what southern California offers. The mixture of great weather and the beach culture, as well as the glam and fantasy angle, can <a rel="nofollow" href="https://meetings.visitanaheim.org/submit-rfp" class="external" target="_blank">make your event as attractive as their next vacation</a>.</p>
