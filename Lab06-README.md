For this lab I worked with Rachel to create the logic to create and download the csv files we all used to do our R visualizations. We also created the wireframes for this lab (located in the "\src\assets\lab6-wireframe" directory). As a group we campe up with the 8 differnt viz categories. I set up the organization and file structure for all the csv files, R projects, and visualizations. I also set up the json file for all the data we uploaded to mongo as well as the lab6data collection in compass. Everything is in the assets folder inside src in the angular campfire directory. 

I personally worked on the Event Categories and Online vs. Offline visualizations and csv files. I created a barplot and dot chart chart for Event Categories visualizations. I then created a pie chart and barplot for the Online vs. Offline visualizations. I made sure they were visually appealing, evernly spaced, and representated the data well. 

In terms of creativity besides styling the buttons to fit them of our project I made sure that the colors of my visualizations fit into the color scheme and theme of our app. I also created 2 visualizations per data set I worked on instead of the one that was required. I then styled the page using bootstrap cards, css animations and came up with the logic to enlarge the data viz images when they were hovered over.

For this lab, I worked with Anya to wireframe this lab, and use the json2csv NPM package and related logic to convert the JSON files in our database into the CSV files used in our visualizations. 

Personally, I worked on the visualizations related to the Club Categories of clubs hosting events, and the Meeting Dates of events. For Meeting Dates, I created a timeline (referencing this tutorial: https://benalexkeen.com/creating-a-timeline-graphic-using-r-and-ggplot2/) that plots the events on a timeline by what month they occur in. For the Club Categories visualization, I created a pie chart (referencing R documentation and tutorialspoint.com) with percentages and a legend. I couldn't find a nice way to fix the spacing in between the different events on for Meeting Dates unforunately, but otherwise tried to keep these graphs readable and with multiple signifiers to distinguish items (colors, labels, etc.) for readibility. 

For creativity, I ran accessibility checks and edited our markup and CSS to follow w3c WAI accessibility guidelines.

For this lab, I worked with Teddy in using our data schema for our project to create a data set to use for this lab. I helped come up with ideas for the different types of
data we could exploit and use to display in our R visualizations. We populated a data set with fake data to use for this lab and made it accessible by uploading it to Mongo. I was in charge of the number of tasks visualizations and the number of driver visualizations.

For creativity, when creating the data set, I made sure to add variances and similarities to create unique and interesting data out of 20 entries.
